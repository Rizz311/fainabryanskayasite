                <p class="top15 italic">In Her Own Words - Paulette Theriault</p>
                <p class="top15">It’s been my greatest honor to have worked side by side with Dr. Faina Bryanskaya for
                  over 24 years.
                  Just imagine how I felt when, in the very beginning, she asked me to help put her thoughts into words
                  for her unique teacher’s manual, Teaching Fundamentals of Music Making, A Holistic Integrated
                  Approach.</p>
                <p class="top15">We met in the summer of 1994 when I attended her Summer Piano Pedagogy Institute at
                  Longy
                  Conservatory and School of Music. I was trying to ‘disappear’ in the back row, but Faina wouldn’t let
                  me! Much to my chagrin, she kept calling me up to the piano and did her best to keep me engaged. It
                  didn’t take me long to understand how fortunate I was to be there — it was obvious every time her
                  fingers touched the keys. The sound was magical! I was mesmerized, trying to figure out just how she
                  could produce such a gorgeous sound, even on the smallest of pieces.</p>
                <p class="top15">Lucky for me, Faina agreed to accept me as a student, but only after I auditioned with
                  Chopin’s Ballade
                  No. 1. She realized it would be a daunting task! Nevertheless, she began the process of teaching me
                  how to become the best teacher and pianist I could be, for which I will be forever grateful!</p>
                <p class="top15">Soon we realized we were a good match because I could help her with most of her
                  writings – syllabi and
                  hand-outs for classes, repertoire lists, announcements, letters, and plans. We met most Thursdays. As
                  soon as the lesson and lunch (only vegetarian!) were over, we sat beside each other in her office as
                  I
                  listened intently to her ideas and did my best to put them into proper English. We decided to take on
                  the challenge of writing the pedagogy book she longed to see in print.</p>
                <p class="top15">What follows here are excerpts from this book. Faina’s assistant Yelena Prizant (with
                  whom I worked to
                  create this website) and I feel it’s the best way to promote her lifetime work. This will enable you
                  to
                  have a keener sense of our beloved mentor’s intellect, personality, knowledge of the subject,
                  language,
                  and of course, her high quality communication skills. It is well known that Faina was one of the best
                  presenters of Russian piano methodology to this day. Please be advised that it is protected under
                  Copyright Law.</p>
                <p class="top15">Quoting from Faina’s above-mentioned book, including a statement from her teacher,
                  Nathan Perelman:</p>
                <p class="top15">“‘Piano teachers! Begin not with positioning the fingers but with positioning the
                  soul: it is well known
                  that it lives in the tiny tips of pianists’ fingers.’
                  Nathan Perelman”</p>
                <p class="top15">“Introduction. Did you ever marvel that from birth, children have an innate affinity
                  for music and an
                  inherent bodily response to its pulse and rhythm? Why, then, when it’s time for music lessons, is it
                  such
                  a struggle for many of them? Why battle with counting and puzzle over clefs?</p>
                <p class="top15">Children come to to us with their own rich and colorful world, having a natural ear, a
                  perfect sense of
                  pulse and rhythm, wonderful mobility and flexibility, and possess fairly complex reflexes. The
                  newborn
                  musician is like a healthy embryo, maturing fruitfully from the life force within. If only we could
                  benefit
                  from all of this!</p>
                <p class="top15">It’s amazing how quickly and easily kids learn new things. From birth, they are in a
                  constant process of
                  discovery, exploring the world by touching things, and learning by listening and doing. Youngsters
                  understand music or speech in terms of the unit of meaning. They generally do not hear letters, and
                  it is
                  difficult for them to slow down enough to hear the individual letters of a word. They learn words,
                  not
                  letters. It’s similar in music. Children can sing like birds or repeat a little tune to you, but if
                  you ask
                  them how many notes it has or how many times the same note is repeated, they are lost. They hear the
                  entire pattern as one element.</p>
                <p class="top15">There are so many pedagogical books and methods for teaching music in the U.S. and
                  around the globe.
                  Some of them are excellent, especially in later levels. In spite of this bevy of choices, teachers
                  often
                  have trouble with the same problems they encounter while teaching. Over and over again, throughout
                  three decades of teaching teachers in different parts of the world, I have found that instructors
                  come to
                  me with the same issues: students become tense, and after only a few lessons lose their natural sense
                  of
                  rhythm. They often suffer attempting to read music, especially in the bass clef, or when they
                  improvise
                  or play by ear, and become easily bored with the repertoire. Given the wealth of resources, doesn’t
                  this
                  sound strange?</p>
                <p class="top15">Another quandary is that it’s seemingly impossible to cram so much into the space of
                  one lesson:
                  playing by ear and improvising, learning theory and developing technique, acquiring sight-reading and
                  memorization skills. Even if one could magically cover them all, these aspects are still taught as
                  separate
                  entities that sometimes work against each other (e.g., memorization and sight-reading).</p>
                <p class="top15">These concerns haunted me. I became preoccupied with finding another approach,
                  searching for the
                  “whole picture” from a global perspective.</p>
                <p class="top15">In my view music is a living force that exists innately within us. My close
                  observations of nature and
                  living creatures, as well as of children, have revealed an endless source of images and impressions.
                  The
                  basic tenet of my approach is that the elements of music have meaning, character and emotional
                  energy. The ear comes first and everything else is an extension from it. The eye-ear-finger circle
                  should
                  then become an organic and constant coalition for music-making. Experience comes naturally in the
                  process of music-making: singing, clapping, playing by ear, improvising, writing down and transposing
                  familiar songs, and then modeling rhythmic and melodic patterns. These patterns are generalized by
                  comparing familiar songs, thereby acquiring a basic vocabulary of patterns by focusing on one element
                  –
                  like rhythm or pitch — at a time.</p>
                <p class="top15">For years, piano teachers and students have been successfully using my Key to Music
                  Making (in three
                  volumes). Teachers I have worked with in my Piano Pedagogy classes, workshops, and international
                  conferences and conventions have asked me to explain and elaborate the concepts underlying those
                  books. I couldn’t do that in a rushed Question and Answer period. So here, at last, is a teacher’s
                  manual
                  for them.....for you.</p>
                <p class="top15">This book stands on its own, but it is best (in my opinion) to use it in conjunction
                  with The Key to Music
                  Making — until I come up with something else even better!”</p>
                <p class="top15">“About this book. What you are about to read is not just another addition to the huge
                  library of
                  pedagogical and reference books. Rather, it is a guide, a workbook, for teaching music from the very
                  beginning through the piano.</p>
                <p class="top15">My holistic and integrated approach is the culmination of a lifetime of my teaching
                  and performing,
                  research and study in the field of Piano Pedagogy. It integrates the best features of the European,
                  Russian, and American piano schools, and it really fits with other methods that reinforce my ideas. I
                  have drawn from the ideas of Zoltan Kodaly, Carl Orff, Emile Dalcroze, Alexander Technique, and
                  others
                  that help to develop fine musicians.</p>
                <p class="top15">Most importantly, I have devised a pathway that establishes an immediate connection
                  between the ear
                  and the keyboard through the ten “voice boxes” in our fingertips, thereby establishing a second human
                  speech organ.</p>
                <p class="top15">I believe and recommend that all elements of music making must be taught as one skill
                  from the very
                  beginning. Even the most complex ideas may be presented simply through game-playing and vivid
                  imagery, in a way that is easy for students of all ages to grasp and remember.</p>
                <p class="top15">MY GOALS are:</p>
                <ul class="list15">
                  <li class="list15">To plant and nourish love and understanding for music language</li>
                  <li class="list15">To cultivate a “musical ear” in the finger pads</li>
                  <li class="list15">To develop a sense of overall musical space on the keyboard and in notation, and</li>
                  <li class="list15">To have the pleasure to move around freely within its entire space</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="top15">Curiosity leads to discovery. When the excitement of exploration comes while learning
                  the world of
                  music, then there is no limit to imagination!”</p>
